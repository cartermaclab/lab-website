The **Action, Cognition, and Metascience Lab** is an interdisciplinary research team interested in how the human brain controls and learns skilled actions in healthy and clinical populations. We also conduct metascience research to gain insights into research practices within kinesiology and related areas. The lab is located in the Ivor Wynne Centre, which is home to the [Department of Kinesiology](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/kinesiology/){target="_blank"} within the [Faculty of Science](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/){target="_blank"} at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/){target="_blank"}.
