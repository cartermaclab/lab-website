:::{#hero-heading}

I joined the lab in September 2022 after completing my undergraduate studies at McMaster University in the School of Interdisciplinary Science. I am interested in motor cognition, specifically understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms of motor interactions between multiple agents. My research focuses on decision making in collaborative human-human interactions. In my free time I enjoy playing the drums and teaching the lab about Harry Styles.
