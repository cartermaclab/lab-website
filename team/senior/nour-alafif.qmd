I joined the lab in September 2022 after completing my undergraduate studies at McMaster University in the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience, and Behaviour. My research interests include sensorimotor interactions (e.g., human-agent and human-human) and how different partners and forms of interaction influence motor learning. Other things I contribute to the lab include attempting to help with code and also making everyone feel better about themselves by being impressively bad at bowling.
