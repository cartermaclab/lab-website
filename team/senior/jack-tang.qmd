:::{#hero-heading}

I joined the lab in September 2023 after completing my Master of Science in Physical Therapy at the University of Toronto. Prior to that, I completed an undergraduate degree here at McMaster University where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology. My research interests include the impact of exercise and/or physical activity on optimal aging, in particular cognition and mobility. My extracurricular interests include rock climbing and finding new places to eat!
