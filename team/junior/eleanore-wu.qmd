:::{#hero-heading}

I joined the lab as an undergraduate research assistant in May 2024. My research interests include human-agent and human-human interactions, as well as investigating how these factors could affect motor learning. Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing badminton and volleyball, baking, and drinking bubble tea.
