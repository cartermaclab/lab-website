:::{#hero-heading}

I joined the lab in September 2023 as a research practicum student and I am in my third year of the Honours Neuroscience program. My research interests include sensorimotor interactions and motor learning metascience. Outside of lab, I am a cat parent who loves food hunting in Hamilton and the GTA.
