:::{#hero-heading}

I joined the lab in January 2024 as a practicum student. I am in my third year as an undergraduate neuroscience student. My research interests include investigating somatosensory and motor systems, and I also enjoy learning about computer science and organic chemistry on the side. In my spare time I like to rock climb, work out, read (mostly sci-fi and fantasy), and play video games and sports.
