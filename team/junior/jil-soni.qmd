I joined the lab in January 2024 as a research practicum student. I am in my third year of Life Sciences (Sensory Motor Systems specialization) with a minor in Statistics. My research interests include sensorimotor interactions and cooperative decision-making. Outside of the lab, I enjoy reading a good book, painting, and going on hikes!
