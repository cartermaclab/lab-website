:::{#hero-heading}

I joined the lab in September 2023 as an undergraduate thesis student and I am in the final year of my undergraduate degree in Life Sciences (Sensory Motor Systems specialization) with a minor in English and Cultural Studies. For my thesis work, I will be investigating cooperative decision-making. In my free time, I like to read, run, and play the piano.
