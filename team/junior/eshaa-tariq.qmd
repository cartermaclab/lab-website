:::{#hero-heading}

I joined the lab in May 2024 as an undergraduate research assistant. I am currently enrolled in the Honours Kinesiology program at McMaster. My research interests include proprioception and how it particularly relates to sensorimotor interactions. Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing volleyball, reading fictional novels, and watching true crime and horror shows.
