:::{#hero-heading}

I joined the lab in September 2023 as an undergraduate thesis student and I am in my fourth year pursuing both a Honours Kinesiology and Mathematical Sciences Degree with a minor in Psychology. For my thesis work, I will be investigating sensorimotor human-human interactions and rehabilitation. Outside the lab, I enjoy playing the guitar, reading and staying active with friends.
