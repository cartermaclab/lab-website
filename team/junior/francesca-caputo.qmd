I joined the lab in January 2024 as a practicum student. I am currently in the third year of my undergraduate degree in the Biology Research Specialization. My research interests include motor learning and the dynamics of neural circuits. Outside of the lab, I enjoy testing out new recipes, going on adventures with my friends, and playing the guitar!
