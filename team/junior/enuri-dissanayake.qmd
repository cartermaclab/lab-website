I joined the lab in September 2023 as a practicum student, and I am currently in my third year of my undergraduate degree in Life Sciences (Sensory Motor Systems). My research interests include motor learning and collaborative decision-making. Outside of the lab, I enjoy dragonboating, working out with friends, and finding new music!
